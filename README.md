# Astro
A Discord app that makes sharing music easier.

Astro is a Discord app that makes sharing music easier. It passively sits in your server, scans music service links from Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube/YouTube Music, Deezer and TIDAL, and provides more links to where you can find said music.

## Installation
Since Astro is just a Discord app, clicking the link below lets you add it to a server, or as an user app for a command-only experience.
