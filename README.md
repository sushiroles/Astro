# Astro
A Discord app that makes sharing music easier.

Astro is a simple Discord app. It detects URL-s from Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music and such, does some behind-the-scenes magic, and gives you links to more places to listen to that music. Gone are the days of having to look up songs on different services because you decided to use TIDAL instead of Spotify.

## Installation
Since Astro is just a Discord app, clicking the link below lets you add it to a server, or host it as an user app for a command-only experience.
